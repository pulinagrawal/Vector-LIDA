CV Research Rough notes/ Ideas

Intial Setup
	- Take Prof. A's Enviromnment and modifying to fit the CV problem more closly
	- Need to run through written code with Prof. to sanity check
	- Will need some arbitrary frames from non-examples of throwing
	- Using cv2 for camera managment
	- Using apple openclip to handle the embedding of frames
	- Have a collection of throwing frames
	- Comparing the live frames similarity to the throwing and not throwing frame in order to make the decision
	- Scheme seems to be choosing record but is not recording
	Issue
		- When I am in frame it thinks it is throwing
		- If I cover the camera then it senses as not throwing
		- Not "learning" or imporoving, it is purely comparing to the "known" frames
	Impovement Attempts
		- Including multiple reference frames and taking the average
		
	First Results
		- It records whenever I am in the frame. 
		- It does not record when the frame is empty ever though.
		- Choppy video Results	
			- Attempting to multi-thread the video recording to smooth out the recording
